## Intro
* Remember clients/users do not care about the code itself
* They have a problem they want addressed
* Remember the software you make is judged by "outside" metrics: customer retentions, cost savings, etc.
* These are the expectations of values behind every project you do
* How do you deliver:
	* Team should be on the same page
	* Find a path that moves towards those expectations
	* Understand user requirements and make a "doc"
		* [[The Requirements Pit]]
		* Can tweak those things as well and make suggestions
	* Continue to have expectations in mind
* At the end of the day you are a problem solver
