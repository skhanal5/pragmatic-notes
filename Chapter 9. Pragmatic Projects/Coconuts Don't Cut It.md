## Intro
* TLDR: Don't become a cargo cult
* Don't fall into a trap where your imitating some system hoping that the thing that you desire happens
* Ex: Using a broken version of Scrum but thinking it is OK because it is using Jira somehow
## Context Matters
* Do what works and not what is fashionable
* Don't blindly adopt practices from top engineering companies
* What works for them doesn't work for you
	* For reasons like different organization size, user base, constraints, etc.
* If you are really tempted, pilot and prototype
	* Keep what works and ignore what doesn't
## One Size Fits No One Well
* [[The Essence of Agility]]
	* There is no single plan you can follow when you develop software
* Take bits and pieces of all methodologies and implement them
	* Scrum, Agile, XP, etc.
## The Real Goal
* Deliver software in a timely manner (aka now)
* Shouldn't be a tedious effort to roll out changes
	* If its taking too long, try to cut down delivery time
* remember you are delivering when your users need changes not constantly
* to do continuous development, you need good infrastructure
	* [[Pragmatic Starter Kit]]
* Once you establish infrastructure, then figure out how to organize the work
