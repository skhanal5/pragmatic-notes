## Intro
* Don't produce perfect bug-free software, it's impossible
* Suggested to instead make "good-enough" software - one that addresses your users, future maintainers, and you
* Note: good-enough != sloppy
## Involve Your Users in the Trade-Off
* Scope and quality of the system we produce is apart of the system's requirements
* Address user's needs, address the "how good should it be" question
* Users would prefer software that is a rough state *now* and prefer a polished version *later on*
## Know When To Stop
* Don't over engineer
