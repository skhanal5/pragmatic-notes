## Intro
* Software rot/technical debt are big problems in modern day software
* A factor that contributes this is team psychology
* Study mentions one broken window left alone resulted in a city's ruin
	* Mainly because people saw one broken window and then became lax about standards
	* Hopelessness is contagious
	* Reinforces the idea that "nothing can be fixed"
* Don't leave broken windows in your code
	* If you don't have time to fix it, make a comment or take *some* course of action
* Neglect accelerates rot!
## First, Do No Harm
* Don't cause collateral damage just because there is some type of lingering crisis
* Don't be the first to make a mess and start additional damage
*
