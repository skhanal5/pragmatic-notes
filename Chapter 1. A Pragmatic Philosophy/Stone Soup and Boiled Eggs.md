## Intro
* Sometimes your are in a situation where you know what needs to be done but don't have everything you need to accomplish it
* Work out what you can reasonably ask for
* Make it, demo it and suggest other things to add as well as their benefits
* If people see success, they will follow
## The Villager's Side
* Don't lose sight of your goals
* We do not want to drift away from our project's requirements and start making things too complex
* Recall the frog story: frog doesn't notice it is being cooked if you put it in a pan with cold water
	* In this case, the frog literally doesn't notice the change
	* Don't be the frog, look around you
