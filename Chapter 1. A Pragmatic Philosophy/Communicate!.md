## Know Your Audience
* Need to be able to pitch the message the right way according to the group
* Also ask for feedback
	* Body language, facial expressions
## Know What You Want to Say
* Plan out what it is you want to convey
* Write an outline
* INAG110 style works well
* Reflect on the outline and check to see if it relays information to your audience well
## Choose Your Moment
* Time is everything
* Don't ask to speak to others on your time, consider others
* If you don't know if its appropriate, then ask...
## Choose a Style
* Some people need formalities, others are upfront
* If some format doesn't work, tell them and get feedback
## Make It Look Good
* Produce good looking documents
* Markdown
	* Page headers
	* footers
* Spelling
## Involve Your Audience
* Involve your readers with early drafts
## Be A Listener
* Don't forget to respond
* Even a "i'll get back to you later" is better than nothing
## Documentation
* Code itself should be straightforward and readable as a form of documentation
* But also make use of documentation from source code commentts
* Don't overcomment either
	* Violates [[DRY - The Evils of Duplication]]
	* For every change, you need to update the comment
