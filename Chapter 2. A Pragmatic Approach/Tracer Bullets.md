## Intro
* Tracer bullet development is the need for immediate feedback under actual conditions w/ a moving goal
## Code That Glows in the Dark
* First areas to code will be the important requirements AND the areas where you have doubts/risks
* Find a minimal requirement that makes use of all components/layers and test out very basic functionality
	* From there, implement the complex parts 
* Alternative approach: code individual components and bring them together and hope it works
* Benefits of tracer approach:
	* Users can see bare minimum version + incremental updates
	* Developers have a foundation and structure to work off of
	* Have consistent integration available
	* Easy to demo
	* Easy to see progress
## Tracer Bullets Don't Always Hit Their Target
* You can easily modify your tracer code to bring it on target
## Tracer Code vs Prototyping
* Prototype: build components of final system and throw away any mistakes -> recode later
	* Each component is prototyped and tested in isolation
* Tracer code: want to see how the application works as a whole
	* show users how interactions work in practice
	* give developers a skeleton
	* once components are together in a framework, you add new functionality
