## Intro
* Good to know how to estimate in order to see if thing are feasible in the real world
* Helps to determine optimizations as well
## How Accurate is Accurate Enough?
* Determine context of situation which will determine how accurate you need to be
* Units can obviously influence sentiment (i.e., days vs months)
## Where Do Estimates Come From?
* Get insights from those who have already been in a similar situation to approximate
## Understand What's Being Asked
* Think about scope before guessing
* Mention scope in your estimate
## Build a Model of the System
* Include steps your organization uses during development + a rough mental model of the implementation
* Note: mental models will produce inaccuracies
	* Revisions can alleviate this but ultimately EXP is what matters the most
## Break the Model into Components
* Decompose model into components
* Determine that influence each component and influence the model altogether
## Given Each Parameter a Value
* Pass in dummy values and see how the parameter affects the result
* Significant parameters are ones that have a scalar factor 
* Should have a reasonable way of calculating these figures as well
	* Use existing systems or literalyl measure it
* Will have to base estimates on subestimates
	* Introduces error
## Calculate The Answers
* Run multiple caclualtions
* Vary parameters
* Record estimates and provide a range according to parameter values
* Make note of outliers
## Keep Track of Your Estimating Prowess
* Record estimates to see how close you are
* If you are far away obviously take the time to determine what went wrong
## Estimating Project Schedules
* Painting the Missile
	* Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT)
		* A "range" of estimates
		* Optimistic
		* Most Likely
		* Pessimistic
	* Results in overconfidence
* Eating the Elephant
	* For each iteration in the development process, redefine the timetable and estimate
