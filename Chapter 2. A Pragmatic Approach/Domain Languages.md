## Intro
* Languages influence how you think of a problem and how you communicate
* Write code using vocabulary of application domain 
* Sometimes can program using the exact vocab, syntax, and semantics of domain
## Some Real-World Domain Languages
* Ansible is a notable example provided
	* Uses YAML to construct instance and configure specs
## Characteristics of Domain Languages
* RSpec and Phoenix -> written in host language -> compiled -> run as regular code -> external languages
* Cucumber and Ansible -> written in their own language -> external languages
## Trade-Offs Between Internal and External Languages
* Internal Language:
	* Pros:
		* can take advantages of host language
	* Cons:
		* Bound to syntax and semantics of that language
* External Languages
	* Pros:
		* No language restrictions
	* Cons:
		* Need a parser
