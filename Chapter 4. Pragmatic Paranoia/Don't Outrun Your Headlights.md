## Intro
* Take small steps, check for feedback and adjust before proceeding
* Rate of feedback is our speed limit
* Never take a step/task that is too big
* Feedback is:
	* unit tests on code changes
	* user demo/conversation on features
	* REPL input response when learning API/algos
* Tasks that are too big:
	* anything that requires fortune telling
	* work that realistically need months of time
	* guessing future needs of end users
	* guessing future tech
* Don't try to guess the future, make your code future proof in anticipating of it instead
	* Easily replaceable code makes everyone's life easier
