## Fear of the Blank Page
* Starting a new project is a pain
* Two problems that cause this:
	* You have some underlying doubt about the thing your are starting
		* Think everything through and figure out what is wrong
	* Might be afraid to make mistakes
## Fighting Yourself
* When your writing code and it feels like it is hard or taking a lot of effort:
	* Probably something went wrong
		* Structurally incorrect code?
		* Overcomplicating the situation?
		* Creating a buggy feature?
## How to Talk Lizard
* First take some time and space -> organize yourself -> take *breaks*
* If that doesn't work, externalize the issue
	* Draw it out
	* Talk to someone about it
* Prototyping
	* just build it out
## It's Playtime
* Prototyping is a skill you need to acquire
	* When stuck, explore some aspect of the project
* Author's suggestion lol:
	* "im prototyping" note
	* understand that prototypes are meant to fail and eventually thrown away
	* comment what you want to learn/do
	* start coding
* If at any point your doubts are legit, address it
* Otherwise, rinse and repeat the steps in the last section
## Not Just Your Code
* Need to be able to understand other people's code and thought process as well
* Approaches:
	* Read code, function by function & take notes on important stuff
	* Or spot *weird* parts of their code, write it down, look for patterns
		* Try to see why they did it that way
## Not Just Code
* Read your gut
