## Intro
* Trick to solving puzzles is to find constraints and find a solution therein
* Absolute constraints need to be honored
## Degrees of Freedom
* Find the constraints you have imposed on you
* Find the degrees of freedom and using this find your solution
* Write down all possible paths
	* Challenge all preconceived notions
	* Don't dismiss anything
	* Prove anything you think won't work
* Categorize and prioritize the constraints
	* Find the most restricting things and fit the others within them
## Get Out of Your Own Way
* If your stuck on a particular task do something else
* Distracting yourself can help you solve problems rather than thinking about it all the time
## Fortune Favors the Prepared Mind
* Having prior experience is obviously key
* Making note of that is a good way of recollecting things that can help you solve problems
