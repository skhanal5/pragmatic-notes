## Intro
* Agile values to understand:
	* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	* Working software over comprehensive documentation
	* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	* Responding to change over following a plan
## There Can Never Be an Agile Process
* There is no fixed plan in a development process
* Agile is about responding to change
## So What Do We Do?
* Authors suggestion:
	* Work out where you are
	* Make the smallest meaningful step towards where you want to be
	* Evaluate where you end up, and fix anything you broke
	* Repeat
## And This Drives Design
* [[The Essence of Good Design]]
	* Good design produce something that's easier to change than bad design
* Step 3 of our feedback loop depends on change -> change needs to be easy to made so we can seamlessly apply our steps
