## Intro
* People usually say the first part of a project is to gather the requirements
* But most of the times, we don't know the requirements or they aren't clearly defined
## The Requirements Myth
* In the real world, the exact specifications are rare or unknown
* Our job is to help people understand what exactly it is they want
## Programming as Therapy
* Clients may come to use with a need
* Needs aren't immediate requirements
	* Always go a step further an *ask questions* (something you don't do at all)
	* Remember the client probably *knows* the answer to these questions but is assuming that whatever you produce magically has these questions in mind
	* Sometimes you need to be diplomatic and suggest policy issues
* Example: client wants a feature where shipping is free on all orders $50 or more
	* Questions include:
		* Does the $50 indclude tax?
		* Does the $50 include current shipping charges?
		* What kind of shipping is offered? Priority? Ground?
		* Will the $50 promo end?
	* Diplomatic issues:
		* $25 book with $25 overnight shipping -> shipping is free -> $25 total cost b/c of free shipping promo (client takes big losses)
## Requirements Are A Process
