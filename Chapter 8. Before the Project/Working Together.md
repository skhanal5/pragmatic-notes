## Intro
* Talk to your clients and also talk to domain experts at your company
* pair programming: one person typing code while the other comment/ponder/solve problems together
## Pair Programming
* One developer writes code and the other doesn't 
	* Can swap back and forth
* Good becuase:
	* different background and experience
	* different ways of approaching a problem
	* one focuses on the language details, the other focuses on the high-level issues
* Also good because it minimizes lazy habits and mistakes lol
## Mob Programming
* Pair programming but more than 2 people
* Can include people who aren't even on the dev team: users, QA, etc.
## What Should I Do?
* Tips for collaboration:
	* **Build the code, not your ego**
	* Start small (in terms of team size)
	* Criticize the code and not the person
	* Listen and try to understand other's viewpoints
	* Do retro's frequently
* Don't jump in with a naive approach
	* experiment around
